* [req0125](https://github.com/PolitAktiv/politaktiv-requirements/tree/master/en/requirements/req0125.md) PolitAktiv uses open source plugins from the [Liferay Marketplace](http://www.liferay.com/de/marketplace).
  * Code currently is stored here: https://github.com/PolitAktiv/releases/tree/master/liferay/marketplace/6.2 (some of them were downloaded directly from the marketplace, some were build by ourself using the respective code from github).
  * A simple and quick solution describing how to handle those plugins is available.
